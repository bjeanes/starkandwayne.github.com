Developers need tools to get the job done - to iterate fast on a new idea or to maintain and evolve production systems. You do a great job and you're a super hero. I've loved making tools over the last decade and I've loved talking about tools at conferences. It is now extremely exciting to create a new company for the creation, promotion and support of tools and support systems specifically for developers.

This company is called Stark & Wayne; named after the two most famous fictional tool creators - Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne. Every developer can be a super hero.

## Who are the initial target customer and what will we do specifically?

If your company is looking at running the open source CloudFoundry platform-as-a-service (PaaS), then you qualify as someone I'd love to work with. If you care enough about your team and your fellow developers to want to run an open source PaaS, then you and I will get on famously.

and open source documentation
As a website, this site will include lots and lots of articles about tools, libraries and even commercial services that make us all super heroes.
