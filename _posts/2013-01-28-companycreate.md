Welcome to Stark & Wayne, the new consultancy from [Dr Nic Williams](http://drniwilliams.com) for teams and companies using CloudFoundry to make their lives and their customers lives better. We work with teams and companies who want to become real-world superheroes.

If you've used Heroku for your pet projects, then we want to bring you CloudFoundry for your work projects. We also want to work with you on your projects. If you're workplace cares enough to use CloudFoundry instead of just an old fashioned internal IT organization then you qualify.

If the world of corporate Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), DevOps and agile development is exciting to you, then you are allowed to follow the [@StarkAndWayne](https://twitter.com/StarkAndWayne) twitter account. For free. I know, I know. I shouldn't. Hold me back.

Developers need tools to get the job done - to iterate fast on a new idea or to maintain and evolve production systems. You do a great job and you're a super hero. I've loved making tools over the last decade and I've loved talking about tools at conferences. It is now extremely exciting to create a new company for the creation, promotion and support of tools and support systems specifically for developers.

This company is called Stark & Wayne; named after the two most famous fictional tool creators - Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne. Every developer can be a super hero. You just need the right tools. Batmobile optional.

## Who are the initial target customer and what will we do specifically?

If your company is looking at running the open source CloudFoundry platform-as-a-service (PaaS), wants ongoing assistance running CloudFoundry and developers to work on your internal project teams, then you qualify as someone I'd love to work with. If you care enough about your team and your fellow developers to want to run an open source PaaS, then we will all get on famously.

## Initial customers

Stark & Wayne already has two wonderful customers to work with. Ironically, I only wanted to share that Stark & Wayne existed when I knew it had an initial paying customer. But two is so much better!

One customer is a 3000-person non-technology orientated company who has a very innovative engineering organization based out of New York.

The other is the newly created Pivotal Initiative - the new parent organization for CloudFoundry, taking over from VMWare at the end of 2012. In just one month some very exciting open source work has been completed. If you're on the CloudFoundry mailing lists you've seen a little bit of it. It's coming soon. CloudFoundry just got a lot simpler to get installed and running.

## Initial employees

Today it is just Dr Nic, speaking here so eloquently in the 3rd person. Already before releasing this post I have two awesome people who've expressed delight in joining S&W. That made me very happy. It's great to be back running a company and having people wanting to join for the journey!

## Can you become a customer?

If you want a Heroku running inside your company, then you want CloudFoundry. It's also completely open source.

Though its possibly one of the more complex systems you'll run within your company; and will take your team some time to get familiar with its operations and how to customize and upgrade it comfortably.

You can be a customer if you want CloudFoundry for your internal team and want ongoing support and assistance. Once you get a small CloudFoundry deployment running, you'll never stop growing, upgrading, and extending it.

You can also be a customer if you run an ISP or hosting company and want to share CloudFoundry with your customers. You'll then be able to offer Heroku-esque experience for small apps and your dedicated VMs or machines when their applications grow up.

You can also be a customer if you're already running CloudFoundry and want to bring in engineers, front-end developers, management, and more, then I'd love to find a way to help. We're very excited for you, your devs and your ops people!
