James Bayer [wrote up](http://www.iamjambay.com/2012/10/cloud-foundry-vmc-ng-has-helpful-client.html) some instructions on installing and using a rewritten CLI for Cloud Foundry, called VMC-ng or VMC v2.

So I've started a README for the vmc repository's ng branch ([patch](http://reviews.cloudfoundry.org/#/c/11278/ "Gerrit Code Review")) and exploring the new features.
